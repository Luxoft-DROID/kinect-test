# kinect-test
This projeckt aims to explore and test [kinect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinect) features
 and how could they be used for object detection and 3D mapping. 


# What you need to get started
- A microsoft [kinect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinect) device.
- The [libfreenect](https://github.com/OpenKinect/libfreenect) library.
- [OpenGL](https://www.khronos.org/opengl/wiki/Getting_Started) version 3.0
- The project is currently buildable only with[Qt Creator IDE](https://www.qt.io/ide/)(qmake)
 but this may change in future commits.


#### TODO: 
Rework the code in `main.cpp`.
Export `OpenGL` related functions in a separate class.
